Hello! I'm Javier Porras-Valenzuela, a third-year PhD student at the University of Pennsylvania, advised by Professor Alejandro Ribeiro. My research interests include: graph machine learning, constrained learning, optimization, and test-time learning.

In a past life, I worked as a software and ML engineer for 7+ years, applying ML and OR techniques to areas such as Supply Chain, Fraud Detection, and AdTech.
